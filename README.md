A Machine Learning Powered Solution for Soil Analysis, Crop Recommendation, and Yield Prediction with a Flutter Mobile App Interface

📌 Project Overview
Smart AgroAssist is an intelligent agriculture assistant developed as a minor project to help farmers and agricultural professionals. It includes:

Soil Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),

Crop Recommendation using Random Forest Classifier, and

Yield Prediction also powered by Random Forest.

A Flutter-based mobile application serves as the user interface for real-time usage.

🎯 Key Features
🔍 Soil Analysis (Using CNN)
Users can upload an image of the soil through the mobile app.

The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the soil type based manually created database of iamge like differnt folder contain iamges:

Black Soil

Yellow Soil

Clay Soil

Loamy Soil, etc.

The AI model is trained on labeled soil images to detect patterns and features, providing accurate soil type classification.

🌾 Crop Recommendation (Using Random Forest Classifier)
Based on the detected soil type and other parameters:

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

pH value

Soil moisture

Temperature, humidity, rainfall (from weather API)

The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to suggest the most suitable crops.

📈 Yield Prediction (Using Random Forest Regression)
After selecting the crop, the system predicts the expected yield based on:

Soil parameters

Fertilizer inputs

Weather conditions

Sowing and harvesting time

This is implemented using Random Forest Regression for better accuracy.

📱 Flutter Mobile App
A modern, cross-platform mobile application that allows users to:

Upload soil images

Input various soil and climate parameters

Get AI-based crop suggestions

View expected yield prediction

Access real-time weather forecasts
